            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language 
            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
             assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
             scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, 
            images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
             rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
              denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
              links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
              
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce
                content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide 
                    information about document text and may include other tags as 
                    sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them 
                    to interpret the content of the page.

            documents from a web server or from local storage and render the 
              documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
               a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance 
               of the document.

            Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally
             defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the 
             mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the
              "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan 
              Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the 
              grammar.[9][10] The draft expired

            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text,
             images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default 
             characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, 
             and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page 
             designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in 
             the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in
              turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such

            Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing 
            interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input
             from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] 
             However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC
              15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata

        After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development

        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in

        You can declare a variable in three ways:
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
          always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
          warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope

          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web

          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
          variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
          represent a variable.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
          variable in the same scope. For example:

        <code
          >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL

              <li>
                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                other variant.

      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
        is false. An if statement looks as follows:
  
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
        including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code
          >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
          } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
        </code>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
        evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
        them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
  
        <code
          >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
        >
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
        because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
        the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
        assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
        additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
  
        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
        evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
  
        <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
        statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
        statement following the loop.
  
        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
          the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
          control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
          those statements.
        </p>
  
        Example:
  
        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
  
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.

      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article>
        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
  
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
            brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
        </p>
  
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
          the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
          the calling function.
